### Terminal modes

* Cooked - Allows for preprocessing of data and is lined based input. "cooks" characters before sending it to the program 

* Raw - Every character is sent directly to the program. e.g. vi.
** Is typical that QUIT characters are still allowed

## TODO

* dig more into io buffers. e.g. io.ReadWriter
* -> really just explore the entire os package further.

* What is a VT100 terminal?
